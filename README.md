# Bloodline Web Application
A Progressive Web Application which serves to essentially sensitize and encourage users to donate blood.

## Features

* The single-page website will host and present all the information necessary to a donor in an organized manner so that they can be knowledgeable of the process they possibly may partake in. 

* The application will allow users to view the blood donation centres within their vicinity.

* Users will be able to schedule an appointment with a chosen centre. They would be allowed to edit that appointment before the arrival date. The operations which a user will be allowed to perform on an appointment after its creation will include the ability to view, edit, or delete the appointment. 

* Hosts will be able to manage the appointments scheduled with the centre that they are employed in. This will include the ability to accept or reject an appointment in a given scenario. 

* A user of the application will be able to register, login,  and view his account information.
